# Final_Project_Lobstah

My final project will use the UN Comtrade. The lobster trade data between US-China, Canada-China, and US-Canada prior to and after July 2018 punitive tariffs imposed by China on US lobster.

I hope to make visualizations that will accompany my master's project. I will make a:

1. Map of the Gulf of Maine and arrows pointing at directions of lobster from Maine waters North to Canadian waters. (ai2html for mobile versions)

2. Radial chart for 12months of year, to indicate the seasons when lobstering is most active both in the US and Canada (by the end of November, lobstering in Maine slows down and Canada's lobster season just gets its start, the last Monday of November.)

3. Scrollytelling with bar charts to show trade data

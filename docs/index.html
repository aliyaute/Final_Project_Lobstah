However, many lobstermen remember the years when the catch, and therefore the salary was under. Still, they were hopeful that the lobster population, directly dependent on climate, would recover. But today, despite the landings at an all time high, a different force is threatening the livelihood of Maine fisheries. </p> <p>In July 2018, China, the largest market outside of North American for the Maine lobster, imposed 25 percent punitive tariffs on goods coming form the United States. The Maine lobster, an industry worth 1.4 billion dollars, is among the goods that is being hit with retaliatory tariffs.
</p>  <p style="text-align:center"><img src="map_china_us_cad.373745ab.svg"></p> <p>Overwhelmingly reliant on the lobster export, Maine lost nearly 85 percent of its usual export to the Chinese market in 2018. In 2017, the US exported nearly 12 million pounds of live lobster, but a year after the tariffs, the number of exports declined by nearly 10 million pounds.The loss of business soon translated into the loss of jobs. Dealers like the Lobster Co., of Arundel laid off half of the wholesale staff. </p><p>In September 2017, the Canadians and the Europeans negotiated a comprehensive economic trade agreement, which eliminated tariffs imposed lobster coming from Canada to the EU. This preferential trade agreement has already been in effect when the retaliatory tariffs by China were announced a year later.</p> <p></p>

</div> <script src="chart-01.872103a3.js"></script>  <div class="story-body"> <p>“Not only our trade with China is down, our trade with Europe is also down by 20 percent of our historical high,” Annie Tselikis, executive director of the Maine Lobster Dealers' Association, says. And today, Canada is trading with China at an all time high, exempt from punitive tariffs that the US is experiencing. In June 2018 alone, Canada exported 33 million pounds of live lobster to China. In all of 2018, the US exported 2.2 million pounds of the same species.

 <div class="story-body"> <h2>Difference in US lobster sales to China before and after July 2018 Tariffs </h2> <p>
This forced the lobster dealers to re-route their goods to Canada, the dominant exporter of American lobster today. Canada is the obvious winner in the US-China Trade War and the climate change, which is forcing lobster to swim northward, is playing into Canadian fishermen's favour
